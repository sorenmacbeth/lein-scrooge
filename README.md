# lein-scrooge

A Leiningen plugin to run the Twitter Scrooge compiler on thrift IDL files

## Installation

Use this for user-level plugins:

##### Leiningen 2.x

Put `[lein-scrooge "0.1.1"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile

##### Leiningen 1.x 

`lein plugin install lein-scrooge 0.1.1`.

Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[lein-scrooge "0.1.1"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

## Usage

    $ lein scrooge

When no arguments are provided, the plugin will search for thrift files in the directory
specified by the `:include-path` in your project file (see below). If no `:include-path` 
has been specified, the plugin will default to searching "src/thrift".

    $ lein scrooge <file1> <file2> ... <fileN>

You can also specify specific files to be compiled. If an `:include-path` has been 
provided in the project file, then scrooge will include this directory when resolving
filenames.

#### Project Settings

The following settings are supported: 

    (defproject ...

     ;; scrooge compiler supports Java and Scala. (Haven't tested with Scala yet. User beware)
     :language "Java"
     
     ;; generates Finagle classes (see https://github.com/twitter/finagle)
     :finagle true

     ;; directory that will be used to find Thrift IDL files for compilation
     :thrift-include-path "src/thrift"
       
     ;; can be used to explicitly set destination of generated source files.
     ;; if generating java source, then java-source-path will be used by default.
     ;; fallback default is "src/<language>"
     :thrift-destination-path "src/java"
     
    )
